        <h2>The Dark Side of the Industry</h2>
        <p>
            Fortunately, we have many role models within the music industry to look up to. However, there is still a dark side to the music industry. For decades there have been many artists who have warned those getting into the industry of greedy and dangerous business executives. Although the music industry pushes boundaries and motivates pop culture, it can still stifle creativity through toxic and greedy practices. Constricting and controlling contracts that push artist into debt, and toxic behaviors which trap artists into addiction and depression can both be commonly seen amongst the industry.
        </p>
        <h2>Bias & Corruption</h2>
        <p>
            One artist who is a prime example of this is Taylor Swift. Taken advantage of at a young age, her label was able to force her into signing away the master to all of her music released with them. After failing to buy back her masters, she has been forced to re-release almost her entire discography so that she can earn money for her work, instead of fueling a label that completely disregarded and disrespected her as a musician and simply a human being. Although this is a terrible situation, it shows how the music industry can shine a light on larger issues of society such as misogyny and greedy, capitalist practices. Since Taylor Swift is such a huge artist, she has been able to warn upcoming artists about what can happen when you don't read your contract… carefully.
        </p>
        <h2>Labels & Girl Groups</h2>
        <p>
            Another example of the toxic music industry is the cautionary tale of the girl group. This was most popularly seen through Destiny's Child, and Fifth Harmony. First, Destiny’s Child, a young black r&b group out of Houston, Texas. Rising to prominence during the 90’s, and spawning huge stars of today like Beyonce. Destiny’s Child originally started with 4 members, however, there was plenty of trauma caused by the fact that the group’s manager was Beyonce’s father, Matthew Knowles. He often showed favoritism toward his daughter, and her childhood friend, Kelly Rowland. This led to the group splitting up, and gaining new members. Moving onto Fifth Harmony, a young girl group discovered and created on the talent show X Factor. At the time of their formation, their low level of industry knowledge was taken advantage of by their label and manager. They were forced into a terrible contract, which forced them to work long hours, with little pay. Their label also often encouraged petty fights between the girls and encouraged the girls’ insecurities by denying them, singing parts, or pushing certain members behind others. This eventually led to the group breaking up, with all members going their separate ways. 
        </p>
        <h2>In The End...</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, the music industry is a complex business, which can foster creativity, boat representation, and inspire youth. However, it can also be a toxic environment, full of greedy practices which stifle creativity and give rise to depression, and heightened insecurities.
